GLmath
======

A simple C++ math library for computer graphics that tries to mimick
the basic types found in GLSL as closely as possible. It provides
matrices of variable sizes, vectors of variables size and quaternions
of size 4.

Requirements
------------

- A C++11 compiler which supports nameless structs/unions (tested with
  g++ 4.9.2 and clang++ 3.5.1).

Building
--------

`autoconf`

`./configure`

`make install`

It is also possible to simply copy the hpp files to your project.
